__About myself:__

My acquaintance with programming happened about 2 years ago. I was wondering how websites are created. In my free time from my main job, I graduated from web design courses, also watched some lessons on youtube. While developing website design, I became interested in how my projects are translated into code. So I found a layout course and continued the process of self-education. I really like writing code, because I can immediately see the result of my work. I am very glad that by trial and error, I finally found exactly what I like to do and get incredible pleasure from it.
My goal is to study a new, interesting profession that gives unlimited opportunities for development and become a good Frontend Developer in the near future. And I believe that I will succeed.

My goal is to become a frontend developer. And this means having fun at work and, due to the global changes in everyday life due to the pandemic, the opportunity to work remotely.
My strengths are:
- independence;
- perseverance;
- honesty;
- hard work;
- responsibility;
- tolerance;
- able to see the positive, learn from failures and follow on.

    if (a !=null && b !=null && a != '' && b !='' && a.length < 50) {
        personalMovieDB.movies[a] = b;
